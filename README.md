This is a basic youtube transcript tool that gives you video's transcript

You can enter any languages shortening like en/tr/ru etc...

It's very simple actually but i did it because i thought it will be good for practice in python

It can be good for if you want to use on ai tools, Ex: Giving a transcript to a llm then get a summarize
